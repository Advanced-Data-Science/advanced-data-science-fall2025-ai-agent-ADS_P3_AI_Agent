    "A cat can jump up to five times its own height in a single bound.",
    "Most cats give birth to a litter of between one and nine kittens. The largest known litter ever produced was 19 kittens, of which 15 survived.",
    "The cat's clavicle, or collarbone, does not connect with other bones but is buried in the muscles of the shoulder region. This lack of a functioning collarbone allows them to fit through any opening the size of their head.",
    "A cat has more bones than a human being; humans have 206 and the cat has 230 bones.",
    "A commemorative tower was built in Scotland for a cat named Towser, who caught nearly 30,000 mice in her lifetime."
